# Daily Coding Challenges
This is a space where I store my attempts at the Daily Coding Challenges provided by https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/

I intend to spend 1 hour every day trying to solve the challenge in as many ways as I can.

## Goals
* Find efficient and creative solutions
* Solve different problems with different programming languages

## Structure
In each source file there will be a number of functions named __soln#__. These indicate each subsequence solution to the puzzle where soln1 is the first iteration. Only solutions that worked within the hour will be included.

After the hour I will research best solutions if I can find a better implemenation then mine I will implement that solution and include it as a function named __answer__.

Each challenge will include some sort of unit testing, when aplicable the testing functionality will be called via the function named __test__.

The top of every source file will include a comment describing how to run it.
